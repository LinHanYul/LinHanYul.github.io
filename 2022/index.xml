      <description>Hello here is my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m a simple student for a simple college, and this is my first time messaging something on blog. Yesterday, from morning to noon I spent a lot of time on how to created my blog. Also I met many different problem. Though I finally solved those problem, but after I had finished it, there were still many classmates didn&amp;rsquo;t done that. May be next week, after I finish my teamwork I will upload a detailed process of building a blog.</description>
